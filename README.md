# NSimpleClipper

NSimpleClipper is a basic hard clipper VST plugin designed for audio processing.  It provides a simple yet effective way to hard clip audio signals.

## Installation

You can download the x64 VST3 file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/noahdominic/NSimpleClipper/releases).  Installation instructions vary depending on your digital audio workstation&nbsp;(DAW).  Generally, you should place the VST3 file in `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3` as most DAWs search for plugins there.  In any case, please refer to your DAW's documentation for specific instructions.

## Usage

NSimpleClipper features the following parameters:

- **Pre-Gain**: Adjusts the input gain level before clipping.
- **Ceiling**: Sets the maximum output level before clipping occurs.
- **Gain (Post-gain)**: Adjusts the output gain level after clipping.
- **Mix**: Controls the blend between the dry and wet signals.

Simply adjust these parameters according to your preferences to shape the clipped audio signal.

## Compatibility

NSimpleClipper has been tested on 64-bit Windows 11 with PreSonus Studio One and Ableton Live.  While compatibility is not guaranteed, this plugin should be compatible with most DAWs.  Currently, I do not have the resources to test this on macOS.

## Licence

This plugin is distributed under the GPLv3 licence.  See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/noahdominic/NSimpleClipper/LICENSE.txt) file for details.
